# Eisenstein integers
The Eisenstein integers are numbers of the form $a + b\omega$, where $\omega = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}$. $\mathbb{Z}\[\omega\]$ is a ring whose elements form a triangular lattice.

A triangle in the lattice can be uniquely defined as a set of three Eisenstein integers, and a set of six connected triangles corresponds to a unique hexiamond orientation and position in the lattice.
