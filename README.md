# Hexiamonds
Hexiamonds are polyiamonds composed of six equilateral triangles. [Wolfram MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hexiamond.html) gives them the names

# Eisenstein integers
The Eisenstein integers are numbers of the form $a + b\omega$, where $\omega = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}$. $\mathbb{Z}\[\omega\]$ is a ring whose elements form a triangular lattice.

A triangle in the lattice can be uniquely defined as a set of three Eisenstein integers, and a set of six connected triangles corresponds to a unique hexiamond position in the lattice.
